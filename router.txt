double click on the router 
press enter on the terminal

then "conf t" on terminal
*********************************** repit this prossec of all route

then type "int f2/0" the f2/0 is the line of the router that is connected to other router

then type this "ip add 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0" the ip is for the "f2/0" part 
then type "no sh" and enter

then type "int f0/0"
then type this "ip add 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0" the ip is for the "f0/0" part this is the other end of the route witch connecte to the PC 
then type "no sh" and enter

then type "ip route 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0 f2/0" ****** b/c f2/0 is the part where it connecte to the other route
type "do write" and enter
*********************************** until you finish the routers


done setting up the route

*******************************
now config the pc

*******************************
 "ip 192.168.10.1/24 192.168.10.2"
on the pc set the ip and at the end set the getway fro the route
do this for all pc and know we can ping

  to set the IP address and subnet mask for the PC is ip 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1. 
  This command assigns the IP address 192.168.10.2, with subnet mask 255.255.255.0, and sets the default gateway to 192.168.10.1.

  The "24" at the end of "192.168.10.1/24" represents the subnet mask in CIDR notation.
   In IPv4 networking, a subnet mask defines 
  which portion of an IP address represents
   the network portion and which portion represents the host portion.

In CIDR notation, the subnet mask is represented by a forward slash ("/") followed by a number.
 This number indicates the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask. In the case of "/24",
  it means that the first 24 bits of the IP address represent the network portion, and the
   remaining 8 bits represent the host portion.
To convert "/24" to its dotted-decimal representation (traditional subnet mask), you count
 the number of bits set to 1. In this case, it's 24 bits, so the subnet mask is:  11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
When converted to dotted-decimal notation, it becomes:  255.255.255.0
